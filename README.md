# Valentine 💖

An interactive, playful web page to ask: "Will you be my Valentine?" — with a twist! This project is a fun, animated, and slightly mischievous way to pop the question, perfect for sharing with someone special.

## Features

- **Charming UI:** Beautiful, modern design with soft gradients and playful fonts.
- **YES/NO Buttons:**
  - Clicking "YES" triggers a heart explosion and a sweet message.
  - Hovering or tapping "NO" makes the button run away and grow the "YES" button.
  - After several attempts, a "cat with a gun" meme appears, playfully warning the user.
- **Responsive:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Animated Effects:** Floating hearts, button animations, and more.

## How It Works

1. Open the page in your browser.
2. Try to click "NO" — the button will dodge your attempts!
3. After 5 failed tries, a funny warning appears.
4. Click "YES" to see a heart explosion and a happy message.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - (Optional) `cat-gun.gif` for the warning image
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Customization

- Replace `cat-gun.gif` with your own image or meme for the warning.
- Edit the text in `index.html` or `script.js` to personalize your message.
